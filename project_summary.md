## Introduction and Motivation: 
For my 386 project this semester, I decided to investigate the top 200 ranked airports from last year.   
As an out-of-state college student, I have spent a lot of time in airports and  a lot of time flying back and forth across the country. I grew up in Ohio and the fastest way for me to visit my family is by plane.    

I created an extensive table for the top 200 ranked airports in the United States. Data for this ranked list was sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics*1*. 

I want to exlpore the relationship bewteen *2022 Delays* proportion and 
other quantitative variables such as *Elevation* and *2022 Enplaned Passengers*. 
- Does one of these factors have a stronger correlation with *2022 Delays*? 
- Do either of these factors help to explain the variation in *2022 Delays* for the top 200 ranked aiports?
- Which states in this list have the shortest average *2022 Delays*?
- Which states in this list have the longest average *2022 Delays*?

## Methods: 
The methodolgy is summarized in my blog post, [linked here](https://lucystorts.github.io/statsblog/2023/12/05/post2/).   
Ethically, this data is free and accessible online. I accessed free API with various API keys or tokens that I registered for. In addition, the data used does not infringe on individuals privacy or expose sensitive information. This project is completely ethical.   

## Results: 
Results from my EDA can be found within my streamlit app.

- [Barchart Analysis](https://airportprojecteda.streamlit.app/#barchart-analysis)

## Conclusion: 
The data collection uses free available data from the government about the top 200 ranked U.S. airports of 2022. I was able to find more data about each of these and add it to my DataFrame, providing new factors I could use to perform analysis. This way, I could use the EDA to explore relationships with *2022 Delays*. I was able to also narrow down my research question from the free data available, creating a more interesting project. When I began this project, I found data available for purchase that would have allowed me to do a similar analysis, however, the data was priced at $1,500.00 online. Through accessing other free data sources, I was able to make my own version of this data set, allowing me to investigate 2022 airport trends without having to purchase data. This is significant because I feel more prepared to use this skills in the professional world and I feel confident that through free available data and API sources, I will be able to create any kind of dataset I need to and I will be able to answer statistical questions that might arise.
