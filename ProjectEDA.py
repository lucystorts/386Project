    # Exploratory Data Analysis

    In this EDA, I want to exlpore the relationship bewteen *2022 Delays* proportion and 
    other quantitative variables using a scatterplot. Then, I will to perform a regression 
    analysis for the Q â†’ Q scatterplots.

    After, I will use a barchart to analyze Average Delay on a State level. I included a filter for 
    State so that we can investigate the individual airport Average Delays per state.

    In the regression analysis, there is a stronger relationship between 2022 Enplaned Passengers and Delays than Elevation and Delays.  

    However, the R-squared value between Enplaned Passengers and Delays is only **0.085**, which indicates a weak relationship. 

    The R-squared value between Elevation and Delays is **0.006**, which indicates almost no relationship.

    I think the data might perform better after a transformation.
